# A-working-computer-from-Nand-and-DFF
I implemented a computer in HDL starting with basic elements Nand and DFF to such components as CPU and RAM. Moreover, I wrote Assembler to it using C++. Finally, I designed a program that can calculate the number of Nand and DFF in any given chip (C++). Version 2 of this program can calculate the number of transistors in any given chip (C++).
I also recorded a video where I explain how to use Nand & D Flip-flop calculator, you can find it on YouTube: https://youtu.be/_LZWHakxQ3Q

I followed nand2tetris book (https://www.nand2tetris.org/) and used their simulation tools for testing designs.

I don't want to spoil the experience of other nand2tetris students and, therefore, will not post HDL code here.

In this repository, you can find the following:
1) Project presentation = provides detailed insigth into my project with description and examples.
2) Assembler code = assembler that converts nand2tetris assembly language into binary that can be executed by the computer.
3) Nand & D Flip-flop calculator code = finds the number of Nand and DFF in any given chip and can compare different desings.
4) Transistor calculator code = finds the number of transistors in any given chip.
