# Assembler

Assembler converts nand2tetris assembly language into binary that can be executed by the computer.

assembler.h/.cpp - all functionality of the program is encapsulated into a single class.

There are also four examples that can be converted into .hack files (binary): Example_Add.asm, Example_Max.asm, Example_Pong.asm, Example_Rect.asm.
main.c file uses these example files.
