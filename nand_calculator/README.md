# Nand and DFF calculator
This program can calculates the number of Nand and DFF in any given chip (C++). Version 2 of this program can calculate the number of transistors in any given chip (C++) and can be found in a different folder.
I  recorded a video where I explain how to use Nand & D Flip-flop calculator, you can find it on YouTube: https://youtu.be/_LZWHakxQ3Q
